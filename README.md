# cs_345_a3

This is an assignment for CS345 - Human Computer Interaction at the University
of Auckland.

The goal of this assignment was to create a *live* mockup of a wireframe design
which I had earlier developed with a group.

This project focuses in on a simple Art History multi-choice quiz and short
answer question. Students using the app are assigned peer groups and can share
their work and collaborate. Chat and a feedback pane are included to aid in
this.
